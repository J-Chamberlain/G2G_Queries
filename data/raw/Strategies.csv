2,Minimum Generator Loading,Adjust Generator Size to Avoid Wet Stacking,"A generator is considered right-sized if it operates at between 30 and 70% rated capacity. Diesel generators that run below 30% load do not reach the required engine temperature to fully combust fuel, resulting in wet stacking (i.e., unburned fuel passes into the exhaust system). Wet stacking increases maintenance and can cause permanent engine damage. Adjusting generator size to avoid wet stacking helps ensure that generators have at least a 30% load at all times, which can be accomplished by replacing oversized generators with lower capacity generators, increasing the connected load, or using load banks.
